# Stock-market-RNN



The following project uses recurrent neural network to compute the stock market closing prices from a given time series frame of 8 days.

RNN parameters 

1.Input layer 100 LSTMs true return sequence 
2.layer 100 LSTMs false return sequence 
3.Dense layer 50 neurons
4.adam optimiser.



model can be further improved by changing different hyperparameters.
